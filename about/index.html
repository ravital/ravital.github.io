			<h1>About</h1>
			<p> I work as a cryptographer at NuCypher where my research focuses on privacy-preserving smart contracts.</p>
			
			<p> Outside of work, I love reading non-fiction. I also enjoy classical music and opera. My weakness is food&mdash;some of favorites in the bay are Cheeseboard, Gregoire, Cholita Linda, Rich Table, and Mourad.</p>
