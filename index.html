	<h1>Ravital Solomon</h1>
	I'm a cryptographer at <a href="https://www.nucypher.com">NuCypher</a>.<br><br>
		
	My research is focused on privacy-preserving smart contracts. However, my primary interest is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lattice-based_cryptography">lattice-based cryptography</a>, a type of post-quantum cryptography.<br><br>
	
	Previously, I was part of the 11th London cohort of <a href="https://www.joinef.com/">Entrepreneur First</a>.
	I completed my MSc at <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford</a> in mathematics and theoretical computer science; I wrote my dissertation on lattice-based zero-knowledge proofs, focusing on their application to constructing an anonymous reputation system.
	My undergrad was in pure mathematics at <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a>, where I was fortunate enough to be introduced to lattices by <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/">Ken Ribet</a>.<br><br>
	
	I'm also very interested in education. I'm currently volunteering as a mentor at <a href="https://www.mindsmattersf.org/">Minds Matter SF</a>. During my time at Berkeley, I was a math tutor at the <a href="https://slc.berkeley.edu/">Student Learning Center (SLC)</a>. I've also worked at <a href="http://syacademy.com/">SY Academy</a> (a Berkeley affiliate) as a math teacher/tutor.<br><br>
