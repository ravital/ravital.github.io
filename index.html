	<h1>Ravital Solomon</h1>
	I'm a cryptographer and the co-founder of <a href="https://sunscreen.tech/">Sunscreen</a>.<br><br>
			
	Sunscreen is a result of my time at <a href="https://www.nucypher.com/">NuCypher</a>, where I worked as a cryptographer researching privacy-preserving smart contracts. Prior to that, I was part of the 11th London cohort of <a href="https://www.joinef.com/">Entrepreneur First</a>.
	I completed my Master's at <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford</a> in math where I wrote my dissertation on lattice-based <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_signature">group signatures</a>, focusing on their application to constructing an anonymous reputation system.
	My undergrad was in pure math at <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a>, where I was fortunate enough to be introduced to lattice-based cryptography by <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~ribet/">Ken Ribet</a>.<br><br>
	
	I'm also very interested in education. I currently volunteer as both a mentor and part of the alumni engagement team at <a href="https://www.mindsmattersf.org/">Minds Matter SF</a>. During my time at Berkeley, I was a math tutor at the <a href="https://slc.berkeley.edu/">Student Learning Center (SLC)</a>.<br><br>
