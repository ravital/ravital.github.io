	<h1>Ravital Solomon</h1>
	<p>I work as a cryptographer at <a href="https://www.nucypher.com">NuCypher</a>.</p>
	
	<p>Previously, I was part of the 11th London cohort of <a href="https://www.joinef.com/">Entrepreneur First</a>.
	I completed my MSc at <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/">Oxford</a> in mathematics and theoretical computer science; I wrote my dissertation on lattice-based zero-knowledge proofs, focusing on their application to constructing an anonymous reputation system.
	My undergrad was in pure mathematics at <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/">Berkeley</a>.</p>
	
	<p>I'm also very interested in education. During my time at Berkeley, I worked as a math tutor at the <a href="https://slc.berkeley.edu/">Student Learning Center (SLC)</a>. I've also worked at <a href="http://syacademy.com/">SY Academy</a> (a Berkeley affiliate) as a math teacher/tutor. More recently, I've been volunteering with <a href="https://www.mindsmattersf.org/">Minds Matter</a> as a mentor.</p>
